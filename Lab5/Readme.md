Executvie Summary

In this unit we explore networks, network types and how they work. 

Introduction to Networking

Data Transmission
Packet --2. Unit of data
Packet-Switching -- 
IP Address -- 3. Unique Identifying number
DNS -- 5.  Directory fo IP address common names; for example 51.239.26.214 may be the IP address of amazon.com
Protocol --1. Set of rules to allow devices to communicate
Network Hardware -- A hubs, switches, and routers connect devices on an internal network. A switch is better than a hub because there are security concerns.  Any device information that gets ported into a hub gets shared with any other device that is connected. A switch can learn the addresses of the devices that are connected to it, and then it can send a packet to it's intended destination. Routers can read IP addresses, so it can send packets of data to external networks. Hubs and switches create networks, routers connect networks.
Network Topologies -- Topologies are the layout of how a network communicates with differenct devices. A single point of failure can happen in star topology, if a central hub or switch fails all connected computers would fail, and the whole network goes donwn. Mesh topology enables every computer to be connected to every other computer in the network. This is beneficial because when one computer fails, the other computers are still able to communicate. The Infrastucture topology uses a combination of wireless and wired connections, which also allows all the computers in the network to be connected.  Wired mesh is very expensive and requires a lot of cabling, so it is better for very large networks such as the internet. Infrastructure topology is better for smaller networks. Wireless mesh topology seems like the most beneficial type to me because all the access points are wireless which means reliable, constant connection even if one access point goes down, but without the extra cabling needed for wired mesh.
Network Designs -- My diagram is an example of an Infrastucture topology, using a combination of wireless access and a wired router to connect the two computers and the printer, as well as the internet to the two computers through the wireless access point.
NSA/CSS -- The NSA and CSS analyze signals and does data collection in order to conduct intelligence and counterintelligence operations. America relies on NSA to keep sensitive information safe from terrorist attacks or enemy intereception, as well as combat support.
