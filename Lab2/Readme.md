Executive Summary
In this unit we read about the various types of hardware and their functions.  Hardware consists of tangible things you can touch such as a keyboard, a mouse, the motherboard, and the CPU.  We are also beginning to get familiarized with data representation and conversion to decimal and binary.
Hardware: ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU, or Arithmetic Logic Unit, performs all mathematical operations within the CPU.  The Control Unit gets orders from the RAM and breaks them down into smaller instructions.  The Control Unit will receive a set of instructions from the RAM and tells the ALU which operation to perform.  The ALU performs the operation and then sends the answer to a register.  This output will get saved in the register when the Control Unit turns on the set wire, and retrieves the saved output from the register by turning on the enable wire.
Hardware: CPU, input and output
Hardware is used to enter inputs, such as typing a letter on the keyboard. This gets converted into binary data, or a series of 1s and 0s, into the CPU.  The CPU asks the memory how to perform action requested, and then stores the results in the memory.  The result is then sent to the output, in this case a screen, as the letter that was typed on the keyboard.
Hardware: Logic Gates
A truth table represents each type of logic gate's possible input combinations. It shows the combinations of inputs, and what the corresponding output would be for each.  The AND logic gate will output a 1 if both inputs are 1. The OR logic gate will output a 1 if either of the inputs is a 1. The NOT logic gate is the inverse of the input, so an input of 1 will output a 0.  XOR is like OR but it switches off if both inputs are 1.
Hardware: IEEE Ethically Aligned Design
Developers need to be mindful of the moral and social impacts and the effects when they design software for Artificial Intelligence.
Data Representation: Numeric Conversions
Decimals are the Base 10 system,.  Binary is the Base 2 system. Hexadecimal is a Base 16 system, where you have the decimal 0-9, but then you incorporate letters, so A is 10, B is 11, C is 12, etc. 
Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation
ab0ff is 67.1% RED, 69% GREEN, and 100% BLUE in and RGB color space. In an CMYK color space, it is made of 32.9% cyan, 31% magenta, 0% yellow, 0% black.  This is a way to represent colors on websites.  This color could be problematic because it may not have a good a good contrast ratio. Figuring out which colors to use for a website involves finding shades that provide enough contrast between content and background so that visually impaired people can still view the contents.
Conclusion:
I found this unit to be very interesting, specifically the conversion of decimals to binary and vice versa.  We also learned a bit about how computers take inputs and process them to provide outputs via the CPU, RAM, and ALU.
