Executive Summary

This unit's objective includes learning more about operating systems.  Operating systems are the software that communicates with the hardware and provides the functionality.  Windows is the OS on my computer, and my phone uses Android.  We are also doing some work with Python IDLE, by practicing writing basic commands in the shell.

Python IDLE

The Python shell is useful to practice writing basic commands one line at a time.  We assigned variables (spam = 40), used operators (2 * 3 = 8), and learned that there are different data types.  Integers are numbers (3, 5, 8) floating integers are numbers with decimal points (4.0, 4.2), and strings ('Hello world!') To write a whole program, you would use File Editor as opposed to the shell.
Code Examples -- A variable is like a container that you can store a meaning inside. An example would be daytype = sunny; then when you type daytype into the shell and hit enter, sunny will pop up on the next line. The author used spam, bacon, and eggs for variable examples because they are from a Monty Python sketch and we're learning about Python. An assignment statement is how you create the variable's value.  Again, daytype = sunny is an example. A function is a group of statements that perform a task, like the print() function.  When you type print(), whatever value you put in the parenthesis will be the output.  One of the three data types are integer, which would be 3, 5, 7.  Another is floating integer which is a number with a decimal in it, like 2.5 or 3.7. The third kind is a string, which are words, letters, numbers contained within single quotes.

Graphics

Raster vs Vaster -- There are two types of images. Raster images are made up of thousands or even millions of pixels. Using a raster image is good if you don't need to try to make it bigger. Enlarging a raster image makes the pixels visible and the image will take on a grainy look. Vector images are good to use if you do need to enlarge. They are rendered from a form of geometry and have no pixelated appearance when enlarged.
Lossy vs Lossless -- Developers feel that lossless compression is the best method to use because you don't lose any of the original file's data. Lossy compression removes data at the developer's discretion so the file can be saved at a reduced size.
JPG, GIF, PNG File Formats -- JPG, or  Joint Photographic Experts Group is a lossy image type that can be adjusted by the user to control the level of compression. This allows for quality while keeping the file size small.  GIF, or Graphics Interchange Format is a bitmapped, lossless image format. It can have 8 bits per pixel and also allows for animated images.  PNG, or Portable Network Graphic is another bitmapped lossless compression image format that was created to replace GIF, but had a slow start due to being unsupported by Internet Explorer

File Properties

My image design had 5 layers total, four rectangles and a text box. The image is 3.98 mb in size, and  opens with Internet Explorer. It may be better to open it with the SVG Viewer because that's what kind of image it is.

Conclusion

I am really enjoying learning more about coding with Python. I was taking pictures of the side by side shell and run windows and showing my friends, it is so cool and interesting.  I also thought it was fun to design the logo with the Vectr tool. It makes it easy even if you are not an artist.
