Executive Summary

This unit's objective includes learning more about operating systems.  Operating systems are the software that communicates with the hardware and provides the functionality.  Windows is the OS on my computer, and my phone uses Android.  We are also doing some work with Python IDLE, by practicing writing basic commands in the shell.

Python IDLE

The Python shell is useful to practice writing basic commands one line at a time.  We assigned variables (spam = 40), used operators (2 * 3 = 8), and learned that there are different data types.  Integers are numbers (3, 5, 8) floating integers are numbers with decimal points (4.0, 4.2), and strings ('Hello world!') To write a whole program, you would use File Editor as opposed to the shell.
