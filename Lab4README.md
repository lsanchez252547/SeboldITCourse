Executive Summary

This unit's objective includes learning more about operating systems.  Operating systems are the software that communicates with the hardware and provides the functionality.  Windows is the OS on my computer, and my phone uses Android.  We are also doing some work with Python IDLE, by practicing writing basic commands in the shell.

Python IDLE

The Python shell is useful to practice writing basic commands one line at a time.  We assigned variables (spam = 40), used operators (2 * 3 = 8), and learned that there are different data types.  Integers are numbers (3, 5, 8) floating integers are numbers with decimal points (4.0, 4.2), and strings ('Hello world!') To write a whole program, you would use File Editor as opposed to the shell.
Code Examples -- A variable is like a container that you can store a meaning inside. An example would be daytype = sunny; then when you type daytype into the shell and hit enter, sunny will pop up on the next line. The author used spam, bacon, and eggs for variable examples because they are from a Monty Python sketch and we're learning about Python. An assignment statement is how you create the variable's value.  Again, daytype = sunny is an example. A function is a group of statements that perform a task, like the print() function.  When you type print(), whatever value you put in the parenthesis will be the output.  One of the three data types are integer, which would be 3, 5, 7.  Another is floating integer which is a number with a decimal in it, like 2.5 or 3.7. The third kind is a string, which are words, letters, numbers contained within single quotes.
