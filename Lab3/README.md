CCC
Executive Summary:
This unit's learning objectives include becoming acquianted with different catgories of software, virtualization and cloud computing, programming with Python, and different careers in IT.
Virtualization:
Virtualization allows a business to use their servers capacities more efficiently.  If you have 3 servers, one for mail, one for internal company-specific applications, and one for the web, virtualization allows you to split one server into 2 or even 3 to run all three functions out of one.  Then the other 1 or 2 servers can either be decommissioned or put to another use.  The hyporvisor is a piece of software that extracts the hardware's capabilities, which can then be made available for use in a virtual environment.  Virtualization is a technology.  A hypervisor is a piece of software that pulls the hardwares resources and makes them available in the form of virtual machines. Whereas cloud computing is an IT environment that allows users to share resources across a network. THese resources are pooled into a cloud, with management software to allow administrative oversight and automation software to narrow the need for human interaction.
